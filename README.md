## Preparing

In order to successfully build please follow these steps:
I assume you already have installed node.js and ruby (in order to compile sass files).

1- open cmd in current project folder.
2- write the command 'npm update'
3- after the last command finished write this command 'bower update'
4- you can use these grunt commands 'grunt serve', 'grunt build' and 'grunt test'.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
